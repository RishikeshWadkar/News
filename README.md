News App Project
=================

The application connects to the internet and fetches news from the News API using HttpURLConnection, which is then 
parsed using a custom built JSON parser. The parsed information is then presented as a news feed in namely four categories - 
Indan News, Business News and Bitcoin News.
thereby doing away with additional screens and making it easier for the user to access any news category.
